    <h2> Impactful Technologies</h2>

        Prof. Sarasvathy, is a high energy and engaging presenter.  Based on her in-depth research of successful entrepreneurs,  
        she persuasively describes a framework for entrepreunership behaviors called Effectuation.   The Key idea is the successful 
        Entrepreneurs shape the world around for better, with a scale of their choosing rather than predicting/planning the future to precision.

    Key Avenues: 
        <OL>
        <LI> Means </LI> (Bird in Hand: start small with what you have i.e., abilities, expeience and network instead of a super detailed plan.)
        <LI> Affordable Loss </LI> ( Instead of maximizing or expecting a return,  use "is the loss affordable" to get off center and generate options for the future)
        <LI> Co-Creation Partnership</LI> (Focus on creating parterships with nearest customer, supplier, stakeholder and get their "pre-commitment" instead of 
        obsessing over beating the competition. <b>My Take: </b> Story of Tesla's founding in Walter Issacson's Elon Musk bio on how Elon Musk, JB Straubel, AC Propulsion, 
        Martin Eberhardt got introduced is a very interesting example relevant to this. May be another thought on this later ..)
        <LI> Leverage Contingencies </LI> (Make lemonade if come across lemons,  reminds me of Rahm Emannuel's  "Don't let A Crisis go to waste")
        <LI> Worldview</LI> (Control/shape the future instead of focusing on prediction)
        </OL>
