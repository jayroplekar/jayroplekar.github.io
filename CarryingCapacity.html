    <h1> The Carrying Capacity Problem</h1>
    It all started with an innocent and friendly debate with @Srujan, my mathematician/scientist in training son  posing two critical questions 
    upon we watching an interesting documentary  over the winter break: 
    The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-8TDOFqkQA&pp=ygUMZGF0YSBjZW50ZXJz "> Exposing The Dark Side of America's AI Data Center Explosion | 
        View From Above | Business Insider</a> 
    <p>
    The documentary talks about the exponential growth of AI datacenters in US,  their voracious appetite for power and water,  
    and the environmental impact of these datacenters. And fundamentally questions the sustainability of this growth. The two fundaental questions 
    that the documentary posed in Srujan's view:
    <OL>
        <LI>Is there a "known sustianable limit" for power/water consumption for datacenters in the US ?  </LI>
        <LI> Are the big techs essentially absolving themselves of responsibility by using water and carbon credits for others to do 
            the hardwork and possibly at irrelevant places. </LI> 
    </OL>
    <h2> My Take </h2>

    <OL>
        <LI>An idealistic view: All  rapidly growing technologies test the limits of sustainability. Businesses have to work within current 
            infrastrucutre and legal frameworks. As the limitations of existing frameworks due to growth become apparent regulators catch up and 
            incentivize or regulate the "right behavior" to keep  the impact of the innovations beneficial.  In this case (Data center growth), 
            the big players (Google, Amazon, Meta)  are staying ahead of the curve and creating incentives by using credits which will lead to 
            the right solutions to emerge.</LI>
        <LI> A pragmatic view:  The big players are doing what is legal and within their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders.
            If the regulators do not like it,  they should change the rules of the game. </LI>
         <LI> A more mathenatically inclined view (Srujan's): There is a "Carrying Capacity Problem" here,  and we need to explore it further </LI>   
    </OL>
    Me not having heard of the "Carrying Capacity Problem" earlier, offered to be the research assistant to Srujan to explore this further. So here it 
    goes ... hopefully, I will be a good student and learn something new along the way.
