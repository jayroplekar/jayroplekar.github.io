<h2> Key Ideas & My Take </h2>

Prof. Sarasvathy, is a high energy and engaging presentor.  Based on her in-depth research of successful Entrepreneurs,  
she persuasively describes a framework for entrepreunership (my translation: intrapreuners as well) behaviors called Effectuation.   The Key idea is the successful 
Entrepreneurs shape the world around for better, with a scale of their choosing than predicting/planning the future to any precision. 
They consistently deploy the following five behaviors: 
<UL>
<LI> Means </LI> (Bird in Hand: start small with what you have abilities, expeience and network instead of a super detailed plan)
<LI> Affordable Loss </LI> ( As opposed maximizing or expecting a return,  use "is the loss affordable" to get off center and generate options for the future)
<LI> Co-Creation Partnership</LI>
<LI> Leverage Contingencies </LI> (reminds me of Rahm Emannuel's  "Don't let any Crisis go to waste")
<LI>Worldview</LI> (Control/shape the future instead of focusing on prediction )
</UL>
