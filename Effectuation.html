    <h1> Effectuation </h1>

    Prof. Sarasvathy, is a high energy and engaging presenter.  Based on her in-depth research of successful entrepreneurs,  
    she persuasively describes a framework for entrepreunership behaviors called Effectuation.   The Key idea is the successful 
    Entrepreneurs shape the world around for better, with a scale of their choosing rather than predicting/planning the future to precision. 

    <h2> Key Ideas & My Take </h2>


    They consistently deploy the following five behaviors: 
    <OL>
    <LI> Means </LI> (Bird in Hand: start small with what you have i.e., abilities, expeience and network instead of a super detailed plan.)
    <LI> Affordable Loss </LI> ( Instead of maximizing or expecting a return,  use "is the loss affordable" to get off center and generate options for the future)
    <LI> Co-Creation Partnership</LI> (Focus on creating parterships with nearest customer, supplier, stakeholder and get their "pre-commitment" instead of 
    obsessing over beating the competition. <b>My Take: </b> Story of Tesla's founding in Walter Issacson's Elon Musk bio on how Elon Musk, JB Straubel, AC Propulsion, 
    Martin Eberhardt got introduced is a very interesting example relevant to this. May be another thought on this later ..)
    <LI> Leverage Contingencies </LI> (Make lemonade if come across lemons,  reminds me of Rahm Emannuel's  "Don't let A Crisis go to waste")
    <LI> Worldview</LI> (Control/shape the future instead of focusing on prediction)
    </OL>

    <h2>  My Take </h2>
    while most of the discusssion is centered on Enterpreunership,  it applies to intrapreuners as well with right cautions/qualifiers,   YMMV 
    <p>
    The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77UWhfxZRIg"> original talk video</a> and <a href="https://effectuation.org/"> the website </a>for Prof. Sarasvathy's 
    work are linked.  The following summary picture, simply does not do justice to the excellent presentation, but hopefully gives the reader a flavor.
