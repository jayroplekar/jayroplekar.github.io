<h1> Who Am I </h1>
I am Jay Roplekar, an Engineer based in the MidWest of US, always interested in exploring new technologies.
Some times these efforts get too diffused. Hope behind this page is to help organize my thoughts and efforts.

Please note these pages are created on my personal  time and do not reflect opinions of my employer.
I will try to call out my collaborators, wherever appropriate.
